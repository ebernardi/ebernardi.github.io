This course aims to give all students a common background in complex numbers, as well as, an introduction to analog and digital signal analysis, topics that forms an integral part of electronic engineering systems in many diverse areas, including communications, consumer electronics, and control systems.

The course presents and integrates the basic concepts of math for both continuous-time and discrete-time signals and systems. Signal and system representations are developed for both time and frequency domains. Filtering and sampling for both analog and digital systems, as well as exposition and demonstration of the basic concepts of feedback systems, are discussed and illustrated.
