Abstract: This short paper presents a strategy to tolerate the income of additive faults in nonlinear chemical processes. For that, an observed-based fault detection and diagnosis scheme is implemented to generate an early and detailed fault information. Then, this valuable knowledge is used to compensate the effects induced by actuators and sensors faults throughout the use of an integrated optimization-based estimation and model predictive control scheme, which allows to track a reference even in presence of faults. A simulation based on a typical chemical industrial process, the highly non-linear continuous stirred tank reactor, is addressed to illustrate the design process and the performance of such approach.
